## Windows softwares - 
 
 * [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/download) - Fast and Feature Rich text editor
 * [QTTabbar](http://qttabbar.sourceforge.net/) - Enhance windows explorer with tabs (like in Chrome) and Scriptable Utilities.
 * [ConsoleZ](https://github.com/cbucher/console/wiki/Downloads) - Best command line experience with split view, tabs, keyboard shortcuts, easy copy-paste etc.
 * [GitBash](https://git-scm.com/download/win) - Git Bash adds Git version control and some common Linux commands to the shell.
